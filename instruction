Deploy application to Heroku. The application made with Express+MongoDB+React.
Frist: uploading your project on github;make sure you have package.json and package-lock.json; if you are using yarn, you need to have package.json and yarn.lock
Second: make sure your package.json has following scripts:

{
  "name": " ",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "./bin/www",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js ./bin/www",
    "serverstart": "npm start",
    "heroku-postbuild": "cd front && npm install && npm run build"
  },
 
 # "main": "./bin/www" and three lines in scripts are important !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you must have "main" and "start"
 # if your app is not in main branch on github, you need to change it into your branch name; or put your app in the main branch !
 # if your app will run a front file after npm install, add the last line into scripts    

Third: Test if your application can work locally
1- type in local terminal (macOS):git clone <githubRepository url> 
for example:git clone https://github.com/yihongwang001/hello.git
2- type in local terminal: cd <repositoryName>
for example: cd hello
3- type in local terminal:npm install
4- type in local terminal:npm run heroku-postbuild

Fourth: Test your application in heroku local web
